# car-talk-player
It plays Car Talk episodes in a web browser (so I can use it on all my devices). And sometimes, it works.

Why?
Listening to Car Talk in the back seat of my dad's silver Toyota Tacoma was a mainstay of my childhood and something I continue to do today in my present-day death trap of a car, but while hosted on Spotify, Car Talk's RSS feed only hosts four episodes at a time, with a new episode being published every 3 days or so. In order to access the full catalogue, one must venture to NPR's website and use their player, which is... fine (hire me NPR) but not ideal to work with on a phone, nor convenient to access when one must scroll down and press load next for a few minutes to pick up where you left off. Thus, I figured I'd work something out to make it easier.
